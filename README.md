# Quiz-Timer

I created this small web application after taking an assessment test for a position in Web Development training at my current company.

I was searching for a timer online to use during the test, as it was a timed test with a set amount of questions. I wanted to follow how much time I had remaining but also at what pace I was finishing questions. Unfortunately I couldn't find a timer online which would my satisfy my needs. During the test, I had to calculate in my mind, roughly how fast/slow I was completing each question and how it affected my overall pace.

This was very good practice in coding in JavaScript. I hope to continue polish the website and eventually add some nicer styling.
